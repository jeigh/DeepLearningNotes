# Linear Algebra Glossary

## Vector
Essentially an array of numbers.  It can be a row vector or a column vector.  It can be used to represent a point in space, a direction, or a line.

Vector addition and subtraction are done element-wise.

### Examples
* 2 dimensional : [2, 3]
* 3 dimensional : [3, 5, 7]

### Row Vector
A vector that is oriented horizontally.  It is a 1xN matrix.

### Column Vector
A vector that is oriented vertically.  It is an Nx1 matrix.

## Dot-product - Algebraic Definition
The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of the two vectors.

## Dot-Product - Geometric Definition


## Matrix 
Essentially a 2D array of numbers.  It can be used to represent a transformation, a set of points, or a set of vectors.

* 3x3 Example : 
	[1, 3, 5], 
	[2, 4, 6], 
	[7, 8, 9]

## Transpose
Swap the rows and columns of a matrix or vector.  This is done by flipping the matrix over its diagonal.
